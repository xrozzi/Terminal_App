## ATM terminal App

### Description

'Your nearest ATM' is a simple program that will let you deposit, withdraw or let you know your balance.

This program will show the user a menu list and the user can select from it.

By pressing enter the program will initialize.

I found a problem that selecting from the menu is not enough so the user has to enter the option manually as well.
